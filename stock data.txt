Stock Data

1) Parse webpage searching for key words indicating market attitudes

	A) Start with single webpage

		I) Assign weights based on word
		II) Pass data onto analyze data portion

 	B) Move onto multiple webpages everyday in major financial news sites

		I) Done with machine learning (tensorflow)
		
2) Analyze data (Python or C++)
	
	A) Analyze historical stock data (Google finance, Yahoo finance)
	B) Analyze market data words (from webpage downloaded) and compare with NASDAQ, DOW, etc.	

		I) Mathematical computations (avg., box and whisker plots, etc.) involving 
		   various data such as P/E ratio, volume, et...

			*Figure out what I'm comparing (ex. two dates, highs and lows)
			*Regression lines (different functions/rate at which prices increased) based on 
			 different sectors
			*Based on specific dates, analyze what happened that day (why price jumped or dipped)
			 via news sites/words etc. e.g. specific date pull up news articles
			*Each data object (i.e. data about specific date) will have news stories and words about
			 that date for each stock  to compare with other data objects
				
				-Allow for more data to be added to point (i.e. debt, credit rating et.)

		II) Visualize data using software such as R or Python (Pandas) in 2-D or 3-D 
		    forms. 
			
			*Figure out what types of graphs/charts I need.
				
				-Prediction line where stock will go (machine learning)				

			*Results of graphs are screenshots 
	
	C) Analyze real-time data for both (if possible)

3) Display on executable win32 program or webpage (Amazon Web Services)
